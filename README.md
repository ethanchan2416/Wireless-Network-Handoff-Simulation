# Wireless Network Handoff Simulation
## Purpose
Realize and observe the characteristics of 4 different handoff methods in a simulated 16-city-block traffic cross-section with cars generated according to Poisson's distribution.
## Objective
Considering (1) the best relative signal method, (2) threshold method, (3) entropy method and (4) a method of your choice, obtain the **total number of handoffs** for each method over the duration of 1 day (86400s). Also acquire the **average signal power** for each method.
## Problem Discription
A 16-city-block traffic cross-section can be considered as follows:

    -----x----x----x-----
    |    |    |    |    |
    x----O---------O----x
    |    |    |    |    |
    x-------------------x
    |    |    |    |    |
    x----O---------O----x
    |    |    |    |    |
    -----x----x----x-----
