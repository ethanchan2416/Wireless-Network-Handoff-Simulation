# Wireless Network Handoff Simulation
## Purpose
Realize and observe the characteristics of 4 different handoff methods in a simulated 16-city-block traffic cross-section with cars generated according to Poisson's distribution.
## Objective
Considering (1) the best relative signal method, (2) threshold method, (3) entropy method and (4) a method of your choice, obtain the total number of handoffs for each method over the duration of 1 day (86400s). Also acquire the average signal power for each method.
